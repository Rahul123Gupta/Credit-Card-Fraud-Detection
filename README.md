💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help financial institutions prevent fraud by identifying suspicious activities accurately and efficiently.

📖 About the Project

I built this project as part of my Data Science learning journey to understand how predictive modeling and anomaly detection work in real-world financial datasets. The project uses historical transaction data to train machine learning models capable of detecting fraud.

📊 Key Highlights

Performed Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy

Handled imbalanced datasets using SMOTE and other resampling techniques

Built machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree & Random Forest

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluated models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC

Visualized patterns of fraud and normal transactions using Matplotlib & Seaborn

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost
